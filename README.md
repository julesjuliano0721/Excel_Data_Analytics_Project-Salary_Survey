## üí¨ Scenario üí¨
You are a junior data analyst doing freelance work for AskAManager, an online blog that addresses issues regarding management, interviews, and workplace matters. They ask you to analyze a salary survey response form they released online for people who view their website to fill out. For this specific project, your client wants you to provide key insights within careers in the field of technology in the United States.

## üñä Business Tasks üñä

 - Collect subset of data that categorizes as a career in technology in the US.
 - Clean data
 - Create a dashboard that contributes to understanding factors that affect salary such as:
   
   1. Gender
   2. Type of Tech Job 
   3. Age
   4. Level of Education
   5. Experience in Field of Work
   6. Race/Ethnicity


## üë®‚Äçüíª Collecting and Extracting Data üë®‚Äçüíª

 - Used filter tool within COLUMN C (What industry do you work in?) to find ‚ÄúComputing Or Tech‚Äù Jobs and searched for key words such as ‚Äúcomp‚Äù and ‚Äútech‚Äù using filter to add any jobs that could be generally categorized within the same column, considering the "Other:" checkbox allowed for string data type.
 - Used filter tool within COLUMN K (What country do you work in?) to find jobs within the United States. This column was also free form/string data, so every possibility  (U.S., US, USA, United States, U.S.A., The United States, etc.) had to be manually found and considered.
 - Used filter tool within COLUMN H (Please indicate the currency) to find all "USD" to make sure people who work from another country remotely, yet work for a company in the United States are included.
 - Exported subset of data onto new sheet called "US Tech Jobs Working Sheet"


## üßπ Data Cleaning Process üßπ

 - Removed duplicates
 - Edited column names to make more readable
 - Job Title (REVISED): Used UPPER function

     - Added new column called "Job Title" and used filter tool to manually match each type of tech job to the corresponding field that our client provided for us
     - LIMITATIONS: Job titles and roles in the tech industry can vary from one company to another, and new roles may emerge as technology continues to advance. Keep in mind that these categories may overlap, and there are many sub-specializations within each category. Also, to maintain the integrity and quality of the data, only the sub-specializations specifically provided for us above were used, so this left a lot of jobs uncategorized within the dataset.

 - "Annual Salary" Column
    - Changed format to currency
    - Handling Outliers:
      - **Less than $15k**
         - Investigated and deleted rows that contained salaries less than because the annual salary for people living on minimum wage is about $15k    
      - **Between $15-$30k and outliers on the higher end of income**
         - Factors/issues considered when deleting outliers:
            1. Median salary of job
            2. Additional external source of income (not full-time work hours inputed as instructed by response form)
            3. Human error (forgot to add additional zero or added a zero to income)
            4. Level of job title (trainee, assistant would make more sense for a lower-based income compared to a software developer) 
          
 -  "Experience in Field of Work" Column
    - Used "Find and Replace" Tool to clean up structure of each option

 - Cleaning and Analyzing "Race/Ethincity (Choose all that apply:):" Column
    - Separated each race into different columns
    - Used COUNTIF Function to calculate each instance a race was chosen
    - Calculated the sum and percentage of each race and created a table:
  
      
      <img width="438" alt="RaceEthnicityTable" src="https://github.com/julesjuliano0721/Excel_Data_Analytics_Project-Salary_Survey/assets/136859698/83a8c5fe-d4e3-4509-9c63-b14690c90c57">

 - Finally, all the relevant columns for our analysis were exported to a new sheet called "US Tech Jobs (CLEAN)".

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Analysis/Findings üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

 - Software Engineering/Development was the highest paid field in technology overall
 - Information Technology was the lowest paid field in tehcnology overall
 - Men typically have higher annual salaries than woman
 - A higher level of education and more experience in the field of work typically correlated with a higher annual salary
 - Middle-Aged people (35-54 years old) tend to have highest annual salaries compared to other age groups.

## ü§î LIMITATIONS/Issues addressing Analysis and with data ü§î
  1. 84% of responses were from the Race/Ethnicity "White", so the reliability of this data seemed compromised and raised concerns for bias.
  2. Lack of general amount of data or representation within in certain fields of data.
  3. String type data/Free form text-entry can be difficult to clean/analyze with utmost accuracy to maintain integrity within dataset.
