### Collecting and Extracting data needed for cleaning

 - Used filter tool within COLUMN C (What industry do you work in?) to filter out ‚ÄúComputing Or Tech‚Äù Jobs and searched for key words such as ‚Äúcomp‚Äù and ‚Äútech‚Äù using filter to add any jobs that could be generally categorized within the same column considering free form/string was the data type used for this field.
 - Used filter tool within COLUMN K (What country do you work in?) to find jobs within the United States. This column was also free form text, so every possibility  (U.S., US, USA, United States, U.S.A., The United States, etc.) had to be manually found and considered.
 - Used filter tool within COLUMN H (Please indicate the currency) to find all "USD" to make sure people who work from another country remotely, yet work for a company in the United States are included.
