### Collecting and Extracting Data 

 - Used filter tool within COLUMN C (What industry do you work in?) to find ‚ÄúComputing Or Tech‚Äù Jobs and searched for key words such as ‚Äúcomp‚Äù and ‚Äútech‚Äù using filter to add any jobs that could be generally categorized within the same column considering the "Other:" checkbox allowed for string data type.
 - Used filter tool within COLUMN K (What country do you work in?) to find jobs within the United States. This column was also free form/string data, so every possibility  (U.S., US, USA, United States, U.S.A., The United States, etc.) had to be manually found and considered.
 - Used filter tool within COLUMN H (Please indicate the currency) to find all "USD" to make sure people who work from another country remotely, yet work for a company in the United States are included.
 - Exported subset of data onto new sheet called "US Tech Jobs Working Sheet"
